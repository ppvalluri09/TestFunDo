  - Citizens not willing to Vote.
  - Multiple vote casts.
  - Slow and Traditional vote counting method.
  - Long and Nasty process of document verification for the making of Voter-Ids.

What can be done?

<h1>Decentralized Voting System using the Azure Blockchain</h1>

 1. <h3>Ballot Coin</h3>
 
     Prior to the Elections, the Election commission produces some 'N' number of Ballot Coins based on the number of Eligible
     voters for that specific term. Each voter will be provided 1.0X Ballot coins ( X can be any number that the Election 
     Commission wishes to choose). Each Voter will have to spend 1 Ballot Coin to cast their vote to his/her desired party. This
     vote casting process is treated as a Transaction between the Voter and the Party and 1 Ballot coin will be transacted to the
     Party's Wallet.
     
     This Ballot coins can help increase the percentage of people who vote in the elections. Let's see how.
     
     Each voter is supposed to be given 0.0X Ballot coins for voting, but also each voter's stake depends not only on his vote but also 
     the number of citizens who do not to vote in that particular Constituency. How is this achieved?
     
     Let's consider the case of the 2019 elections in INDIA:-

     Just 67.11% people of the total number of eligible voters want to contribute towards their Nation's development, is disheartening.
     So we introduce Ballot coins to resolve this issue. Like mentioned before each voter gets his/her stake of Ballot coins, but the 
     number of Ballot coins each person receives is not only dependent on the people who voted but also on the people who did not.
     
     Let's Scale the problem down to 5 people:-
     
     ![Ballot Coin Schema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44934630/61800748-39fa5c80-ae4b-11e9-8634-d763cdcd7769.png)

     Since the person 'E' did not vote in the second case the stake of the others who have voted has decreased. So instead
     of 0.05 Ballot coins (taken arbitrarily in this case) each of the people who voted get only 0.04 beacuse of the person E. This loss 
     incurred by each person will be larger if the number of people increase. This create a constraint between the people to Vote, 
     because there will be pressure from the society to vote as lack of a few votes can decrease each person's stake. 
     
     Scaling it up to a Constituency:-
