 1. <h3>Ballot Coin</h3>
 
     Prior to the Elections, the Election commission produces some 'N' number of Ballot Coins based on the number of Eligible
     voters for that specific term. Each voter will be provided 1.0X Ballot coins ( X can be any number that the Election 
     Commission wishes to choose). Each Voter will have to spend 1 Ballot Coin to cast their vote to his/her desired party. This
     vote casting process is treated as a Transaction between the Voter and the Party and 1 Ballot coin will be transacted to the
     Party's Wallet.

     the number of citizens who do not to vote in that particular Constituency. How is this achieved?
